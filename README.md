# Fidget Toy

["Fidget Toy"](https://webart-fidget-toy.bespokecube.com/) is an experiemnt I created using [Blender](https://www.blender.org/) and [React Three Fiber](https://r3f.docs.pmnd.rs/getting-started/introduction).

### The goal was to practice creating a minimal functional example that combines the following:

- Performance-optimized, UV-unwrapped 3D model
- PBR maps baked from Blender procedural textures
- PBR materials recreated in R3F
- Interactivity implemented in R3F
- [React Spring](https://react-spring.dev/docs/guides/react-three-fiber) animations
- Deployment to [Cloudflare Pages](https://pages.cloudflare.com/) triggered by Git pushes

Feel free to use and modify this R3F project or the Blender files as a starting point for your own projects. However, if you use it as-is or almost as-is, please give me a mention.
